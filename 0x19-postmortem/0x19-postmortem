Postmortem: Server Error 500 - November 6, 5:00 PM

Date and Time: November 6, 5:00 PM - November 6, 8:00 PM

Summary:
On November 6, at 5:00 PM, we experienced a server error 500 on our website. The issue was traced back to a problem with the 'wp-settings.php' file, specifically related to incorrect PHP extensions. The problem was resolved within three hours by updating the extensions to the correct 'php' format. This postmortem aims to provide a detailed account of the incident and the steps taken to resolve it.

Timeline:

- 5:00 PM: Server error 500 was detected on our website.
- 5:10 PM: Initial investigation began to identify the source of the error.
- 5:20 PM: The server logs were checked for any relevant error messages.
- 5:30 PM: The Apache server was isolated and a separate terminal was used to run a 'curl' command to access the website.
- 5:40 PM: The response from the 'curl' command was examined, and the problematic file was identified as 'wp-settings.php'.
- 5:50 PM: The 'wp-settings.php' file was opened for inspection.
- 6:00 PM: It was determined that the issue stemmed from incorrect PHP extensions within the file.
- 6:10 PM: Steps were taken to update the extensions to the correct 'php' format.
- 8:00 PM: The problem was successfully resolved, and the website returned to normal operation.

Root Cause:
The root cause of the server error 500 was identified as a misconfiguration in the 'wp-settings.php' file, specifically related to incorrect PHP extensions.

Resolution and Mitigation:
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:

1. The server logs were checked to identify any relevant error messages.
2. The Apache server was isolated, and a 'curl' command was executed in a separate terminal to access the website.
3. The 'wp-settings.php' file was opened and examined, leading to the discovery of the incorrect PHP extensions.
4. The extensions were updated to the correct 'php' format.
5. After implementing the fix, the website was tested to ensure that the server error 500 no longer occurred.

Lessons Learned:

1. Regularly monitor server logs: Maintaining an active log monitoring process can help in quickly identifying and resolving issues.
2. Isolate problematic components: By isolating the Apache server and running a 'curl' command, we were able to pinpoint the problematic file more efficiently.
3. Thoroughly inspect code files: Taking the time to carefully examine the code files can lead to the identification of specific issues and expedite the resolution process.
4. Keep extensions up to date: Regularly updating and maintaining correct file extensions helps prevent compatibility issues and potential errors.

Recommendations:

1. Implement automated monitoring: Consider implementing an automated monitoring system that can proactively detect and alert you to server errors and other issues.
2. Regular code reviews: Conduct periodic code reviews to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations or coding errors.
3. Documentation and knowledge sharing: Document the steps taken to resolve the issue and share this information with the relevant team members to enhance collective knowledge.

By following these recommendations and incorporating the lessons learned from this incident, we aim to improve our server stability and minimize the occurrence of similar issues in the future.
